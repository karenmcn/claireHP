This is the code for Claire's Harry Potter birthday party website. It's the first website that I built entirely on my own. It uses JavaScript, JQuery and CSS. I added a slider to share some of the pictures.  It's the site I often turn to when I'm wanting to try out a new feature.  I'm currently working on redesigning the site to add more pictures and a Pinterest API.
